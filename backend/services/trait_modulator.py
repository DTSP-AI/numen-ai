Trait Modulator - Runtime Behavioral Enforcement

Translates agent trait values (0-100) into specific LLM instructions

Architecture:
- Trait value ranges mapped to behavioral directives
- Dynamic prompt injection based on trait combinations
- No hardcoded personality logic - all driven by contract
