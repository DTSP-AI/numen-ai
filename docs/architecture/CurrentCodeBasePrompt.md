Phase 3 is now complete

PlanReview.tsx built with disclaimer + consent buttons.

Consent gating logic added: therapy features locked until consent is stored.

Backend consent endpoint already in place (immutable, HIPAA-style logging).

“Edit Plan” loops back to discovery; “Ask Questions” stub ready for future.

Dashboard flow is smooth: Intake → AgentBuilder → Discovery → Affirmations → Plan Review → Consent → Dashboard unlocked.

Functional E2E pipeline is now real.
User can progress through the first three phases exactly as the roadmap envisioned, including compliance gating.

⚠️ Gaps

Git still unsynced. All commits are sitting locally (7e8db96, f7bd84e, 18a7aef, e1b61ad). Until push is fixed, you’re not backed up remotely.

ElevenLabs voice synth: right now you only have voice selection + preview, not voice synthesis for affirmations or scripts. That’s the next functional step.

Phase 4 (Live therapy): blocked by LiveKit/WebSocket credentials. No progress yet.

Phase 5 (Calendar): untouched.

Phase 6 (API cleanup): started audit, not yet executed.

🎯 Immediate Functional Next Step

Since you called out “this agent creation page is where we utilize the 11labs voice synth module from their SDK”, the logical next move is:

Add affirmation/script synthesis using ElevenLabs SDK on the agent’s configured voice.

Endpoint: /api/affirmations/{id}/synthesize (already stubbed).

Frontend: add “Play” button on AffirmationCard to stream or download generated audio.

Acceptance: clicking play → triggers synth if not cached, plays agent’s real voice.

This makes the experience voice-first and hits your product’s key differentiator.

🔧 My Recommendation

Pause API cleanup (Phase 6) for now — it’s polish.
Instead:

Integrate ElevenLabs synthesis (Phase 2/3 extension)

Wire synthesis endpoint properly.

Store audio_url in DB or object store.

Playback in Dashboard.

Once voice playback is working, resume with Phase 6 cleanup before diving into Phase 4 LiveKit (since that’s heavier infra).
